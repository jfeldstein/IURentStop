	<p>Like most freshman, Jordan wanted to live in a house or apartment 
	and get out of the dorms. Where to live besides the residence halls, 
	though, was a tough question to answer. Friends talked about a few
	of the larger managment companies, but there had to be more to rent
	in Bloomington than Smallwood and Mercury. Where could Jordan find
	other places that he can rent? </p>

	<p>We aim to provide a free	and useful service to students by being:</p>
	<p>
		<b>Comprehensive</b>, searching nearly every rentable 
		property in Bloomington. &amp;
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Informative</b>, providing any and all information 
		that helps students make their housing decision. Wish that IURentStop
		told you something about properties that it doesn't already? 
		<a href='suggestions.php'>Suggest</a>
		it to us so we can work on adding it.

	Ok, so this is really a simple way for me to stick my head in and say "Hi." 
	My name's Jordan Feldstein. I'm an entrepreneurship major with a minor in Hebrew
	in Indiana University's Class of 2011, which means I was a freshman while making
	<a href='http://www.iurentstop.com'>IURentStop.com.</a> It's my passion to use
	business to solve problems, which in this case was helping students know more about what 
	properties are available for them to rent. On any sunny day, you can probably
	find me smoking some hookah outside or listening to music while I'm working 
	on my next big idea.
