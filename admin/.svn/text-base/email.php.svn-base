For 16, I was implying that the suit would have proper venue in Kentucky, where the events occurred, and in Indiana where the business resides. 

For 17, both defendants now live in IL making it a viable venue as well. In this case, they could be sued in IL, IN (Where the business is) or KY (where the events occurred). I got that one wrong because of the same assumption that I made in 16, even though my knowledge of the rest of the proceedings was correct. 

For 18, I assumed that the answer to 16 was still correct. Without personal jurisdiction in KY, Jerry could only be sued in IN where he lives and the business is which also leaves IN as the only place that Ben could also be sued. If I had gotten that idea correct, I would have known that Indiana is not a viable venue for the two defendants. In the end, venue should be chosen from the states where either of the two defendants are subject to personal jurisdiction which opens all three states as options again. 

Thanks for letting me appeal,
